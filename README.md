For this assignment, I chose a violin tune which has various tones and these increase or decrease with time. The screen shows a display with ellipses which visualise the sound waves with the width and the height of the page, On the left hand side top , there is a dom feature, with a link to a line visualisation of the same song.Upon clicking the mouse once, the soung starts playing. The visualisation of the song is static and upon clicking the hyperlink on the top left, it shifts to the second visualisation.
